        <p>
            For far too long, our puppy Marco had been caught in a relentless battle with his own skin.
            <br/><br/>
            Every day, he’d relentlessly scratch and bite himself raw…
            <br/><br/>
            His beautiful, shiny coat became dull and patchy…
            <br/><br/>
            And even worse…
            <br/><br/>
            The puppy energy he always had, the one that filled our home with joy and laughter, was fading away right before our eyes.
            <br/><br/>
            <span class="font-weight-bold">The unbearable allergies were consuming our pup.</span>
            <br/><br/>
            And one night, things got worse than I could’ve ever imagined…
            <br/><br/>
            Our 7-year-old daughter was just trying to reach out and pet our puppy, Marco…
            <br/><br/>
            And by accident, <span class="font-weight-bold">her small hand brushed over one of his sore spots.</span>
            <br/><br/>
            Marco immediately reacted with <span class="font-weight-bold">a sharp bite…</span>
            <br/><br/>
            Luckily, it wasn't too aggressive…
            <br/><br/>
            But it was enough to send my daughter into tears.
            <br/><br/>
            <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic">"Bad dog, bad dog!"</span> I yelled as I pushed Marco away.
            <br/><br/>
            Marco sprinted away, crawling under the bed.
            <br/><br/>
            I still remember the way he looked back into my eyes…
            <br/><br/>
            His eyes were wide, filled with confusion, fear, and something else – <span class="font-weight-bold">apology.</span>
            <br/><br/>
            Seeing him there, so vulnerable, his eyes begging for understanding…

        <div class="text-center m-auto pt-5 m-auto"><h2>My Heart Broke.</h2></div>
        <div class="py-5">
            <p >I realized then that my anger was misplaced.
                <br/><br/>
                Marco was in agony.
                <br/><br/>
                His bite was a desperate call for relief from the constant torment of his scratching & itching.
                <br/><br/>
                That night, the house felt heavier…
                <br/><br/>
                My mind was filled with guilt and worry.
                <br/><br/>
                <span class="font-weight-bold">Lying in bed, I replayed the incident over and over, each time feeling the sting of my own harsh words a little more.</span>
                <br/><br/>
                Marco's pained eyes haunted me…
                <br/><br/>
                And it was a reminder of the bad dog parent I was.
                <br/><br/>
                All this time, I wasn’t able to give Marco the relief he’s been so desperately begging for.
                <br/><br/>
                Every time, I’d just <span class="font-weight-bold">brush it off</span> as a seasonal issue that comes and goes…
                <br/><br/>
                While in reality, <span class="font-weight-bold">I was just giving myself excuses to procrastinate.</span>
                <br/><br/>
                And that's when it hit me...
                <br/><br/>
                There was my daughter, tears streaming down her face...
                <br/><br/>
                Marco, our puppy, tucked away under the bed, feeling like he'd been cast out from the family...
                <br/><br/>
                And there I was, lying in bed, beating myself up over how irresponsible I was.
                <br/><br/>
                I could no longer stand by and watch Marco suffer.
                <br/><br/>
                I owed it to him to find a real solution.
                <br/><br/>
                Not just a temporary fix…
                <br/><br/>
                But something that would address <span class="font-weight-bold">the root cause of his relentless itching & scratching.</span>
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="text-center m-auto"><h2>That Day Was Our Turning Point…</h2></div>
        <div class="py-5">
            <p >
                The moment I promised myself to do whatever it took to restore Marco's health and happiness.
                <br/><br/>
                For Marco, for our family, we had to find a way to bring back the playful, loving dog we all missed so much.
                <br/><br/>
                And after reaching out to my good friend <span class="font-weight-bold">Justin Palmer…</span>
                <br/><br/>
                <span class="font-weight-bold">That’s exactly what we did.</span>
                <br/><br/>

            WRONG.
            <br/><br/>
            More on that shortly though.
            <br/><br/>
            Before I explain further, my name might be new to you…
            <br/><br/>
            <span class="font-weight-bold">So it’s important I introduce myself, who I am, and why you should listen to me.</span>
            <br/><br/>
            You may know me as the man behind <span class="font-weight-bold">iHeartDogs.com</span>, which has touched the lives of millions of pet owners in just a short span of a few years.
            <br/><br/>
            But what might surprise you is that I was never really interested in dogs growing up.
            <br/><br/>
            And the reason is simple.
            <br/><br/>
            As a child, I suffered from severe allergies to most pets, including dogs.
            <br/><br/>
            Yet, fate had other plans for me.
            <br/><br/>
            It was after marrying my dog-loving wife that we decided to adopt a furkid before having children of our own.
            <br/><br/>
            And so, we found Splash, our adorable 2-year-old Siberian Husky rescue who quickly stole our hearts.

        <div class="py-5"><p>As it turned out, Huskies tend to give off less of the dander that causes allergies, and my life changed forever.
            <br/><br/>
            And with every day I grew closer to Splash… 
            <br/><br/>
            It deepened my affection for dogs.</p></div>

                But here I am, the founder of iHeartDogs… 
                <br/><br/>
                A company dedicated to educating & improving the lives of dogs and their owners.
                <br/><br/>
                After adopting Splash, I began to immerse myself in the world of dogs.
                <br/><br/>
                I read everything I could about dog behavior, training, and nutrition.
                <br/><br/>
                I wanted to understand <span class="text-decoration-underline">everything</span> about how to keep him healthy and happy.
                <br/><br/>
                I also started volunteering at local animal shelters… 
                <br/><br/>
                Which gave me a firsthand look at the challenges facing dogs who didn't have loving homes… 
                <br/><br/>
                As I learned more about dog nutrition… 
                <br/><br/>
                I became increasingly interested in the role of supplements in supporting their health… 
                <br/><br/>
                <span class="font-weight-bold">I wanted to create products that would help dogs live their best lives, and that's exactly what I did.</span>
                <br/><br/>
                I partnered with veterinarians and nutritionists to create supplements that were made with high-quality ingredients backed by science.
                <br/><br/>
                But I didn't stop there.
                <br/><br/>
                I wanted to know for sure that our supplements were effective, so I set up a lab where we could test them.
                <br/><br/>
                We conducted clinical trials to ensure that our supplements were safe and effective for dogs of all ages and breeds.
                <br/><br/>
                <span class="font-weight-bold">Through my experiences with dogs, I have seen firsthand how a few simple routine changes can make a huge difference in a dog's life.</span>
                <br/><br/>
                Today, we donate a portion of each of our orders to animal shelters and rescue organizations in need.

        <div class="py-5">
            <p>
                One day, I visited my good friend Richard who also had adopted a puppy a few months ago.
                <br/><br/>
                That was the first time I met their 9-month-old German Shepherd named Marco.
                <br/><br/>
                A gorgeous, friendly, and playful dog that was the perfect companion for Richard’s three young kids.
                <br/><br/>
                The family didn’t know much about dogs, but they needed a big guard dog for their 100,000+ square feet property.
                <br/><br/>
                That’s when they welcomed Marco into their home.
                <br/><br/>
                But, as Spring arrived, things took a terrible turn.
                <br/><br/>
                Marco began to scratch himself excessively…
                <br/><br/>
                Leaving him uneasy, irritated, and in constant discomfort.
                <br/><br/>
                His body was covered with red welts and hot spots, and his fur started to fall out.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="text-center m-auto">
            <img class="w-75" src="https://img.funnelish.com/15696/294304/1709137099-image4.jpeg"/>
        </div>
        <div class="py-5">
            <p>
                And the worst thing was…
                <br/><br/>
                They felt guilty and didn’t know what to do.
                <br/><br/>
                <span class="font-weight-bold">I knew I had to help.</span>
                <br/><br/>
                At first, I assumed Marco's issue was caused by ticks or other bugs that wake up after winter.
                <br/><br/>
                But I was wrong.
                <br/><br/>
                Despite the family’s lack of knowledge of dogs, they always took good care of Marco.
                <br/><br/>
                They brushed his fur regularly…
                <br/><br/>
                They washed him at least once a month, even through winter…
                <br/><br/>
                And they were giving him dietary supplements to support his bone & joint health – a problem that many German Shepherds face.
                <br/><br/>
                Yet, nothing seemed to work.
                <br/><br/>
                Marco was no longer playful…
                <br/><br/>
                He was barely eating…
                <br/><br/>
                And his fur had become patchy and his skin was covered with red welts.
                <br/><br/>
                Then one day, I received a frightening phone call…

                The constant pain and discomfort had pushed Marco to his breaking point…
                <br/><br/>
                He was just trying to protect himself from the pain.
                <br/><br/>
                My wife couldn't shake the feeling that there had to be a solution out there that could help Marco.

                Determined to find answers, my wife dove into research, tirelessly combing through the internet for any shred of hope.

                It seemed like we had reached a dead end.
                <br/><br/>
                However, my wife refused to give up.
                <br/><br/>
                She began to wonder what had triggered Marco's excessive itching and scratching.
                <br/><br/>
                After all, he had been perfectly fine just a few weeks before.
                <br/><br/>
                Eager to get to the bottom of this mystery, she consulted a trusted veterinarian she’s worked together with in the past.
                <br/><br/>
                She revealed that many dog owners come to her in the spring, complaining of similar issues caused by seasonal allergies.
                <br/><br/>
                It turns out that a significant number of dogs suffer from allergies in the spring.
                <br/><br/>
                <span class="font-weight-bold med-text">In fact, 1 in 5 dogs suffers from allergies, most of which their owners don’t even know about.</span>

                It might seem cute when your pup asks you to rub its belly and they scratch their leg simultaneously with your hand…
                <br/><br/>
                However, this actually could be a sign of how irritated and uncomfortable your dog is feeling.
                <br/><br/>
                Let me explain.
                <br/><br/>
                As you already know – dogs, just like humans, can suffer from seasonal allergies.
                <br/><br/>
                Hence why you often notice your dog itching more once spring comes.
                <br/><br/>
                These allergies are usually caused by pollen from trees, grasses, weeds, mold spores, and many other environmental factors that are more prevalent during the spring and summer months.
            </p>

        <div class="text-center m-auto">

        </div>
        <div>
            <p class="py-5">
                And if you’ve noticed your dog itching & scratching…
                <br/><br/>
                Licking or biting their paws…
                <br/><br/>
                Or their eyes get red & watery…
                <br/><br/>
                It’s very likely that your dog is suffering from allergies.

                <div class="col-12 col-md-6"><p>
                    When your dog is exposed to these allergens, their body reacts by producing an antibody called immunoglobulin E (IgE).
                    <br/><br/>
                    IgE triggers the release of histamine and other chemicals in the body.
                    <br/><br/>
                    On one hand, this is good…
                    <br/><br/>
                    These chemicals cause your dog’s blood vessels to widen and become more permeable.
                    <br/><br/>
                    This allows white blood cells and other immune cells to migrate to the site of an injury or infection, where they can fight off any foreign invaders.
                    <br/><br/>
                    But on the other hand…
                </p></div>
                <div class="col-12 col-md-6"><img class="img-fluid" src="https://img.funnelish.com/15696/294304/1709137923-immunoglobulin%20E.jpeg" /></div>
            </div>
            <div>
                <p>
                    Histamine can also trigger allergy symptoms such as itching, swelling, and inflammation when the immune system overreacts to harmless substances like pollen.
                    <br/><br/>
                    In simple terms, this causes the excessive itching & scratching your dog is suffering from.
                    <br/><br/>
                    But there’s one problem though…
                    <br/><br/>
                    Seasonal allergies in dogs don't just disappear once spring is over.
                    <br/><br/>
                    The allergens that trigger the reaction can continue to be present in the environment for an extended period.
                    <br/><br/>
                    For example, grass and weed pollen persist well into the summer and fall months.
                    <br/><br/>
                    But it gets worse…
                    <br/><br/>
                    Repeated exposure to allergens can cause the immune system to become sensitized…
                    <br/><br/>
                    Meaning that the body overreacts to even small amounts of the allergen.
                    <br/><br/>
                    This can lead to long-term allergy symptoms that persist even after the initial trigger has been removed…
                    <br/><br/>
                    Leaving your dog itching & scratching themselves raw without a break…
                    <br/><br/>
                    Which can lead to even more problems…
                    <br/><br/>
                    Like developing secondary bacterial or yeast infections due to their weakened immune system and constant scratching and itching.

                <h2>Knowing this, my wife couldn’t just wait for Marco's allergies to subside.</h2>
            </div>
            <div>
                <p>
                    Marco was suffering, and his entire family was now afraid to come close to him.
                    <br/><br/>
                    With Marco being only 9 months old, my wife was determined to find a safe and effective solution for a young dog.
                    <br/><br/>
                    That's when she stumbled upon a miraculous "newborn nectar" that could be the key to finding the relief Marco so desperately needed.
                    <br/><br/>
                    And as you’ll see, it wasn't just a turning point for Marco, but also for countless other dogs and their loving owners.
                    <br/><br/>
                    It’s so effective because instead of just addressing the symptoms, like other remedies out there…
                    <br/><br/>
                    This Newborn Nectar targets the root cause of dogs’ excessive itching & scratching by ‘resetting’ their immune system.
                    <br/><br/>
                    Here’s how:
                    <br/><br/>
                    The scientific name of this “Newborn Nectar” is Colostrum.
                </p>
            </div>
            <div class="text-center m-auto m-auto py-5">

            </div>
            <div>
                <p>
                    Colostrum is also often referred to as the "first mother's milk".
                    <br/><br/>
                    It’s because it's the first milk produced by mom-dogs after giving birth. (usually within the first 24-48 hours after delivery)
                    <br/><br/>
                    And it is very different in composition from the milk that is produced later on.
                    <br/><br/>
                    Colostrum contains high levels of immunoglobulins and other important nutrients that provide essential support to newborn puppies, helping them to establish a strong immune system and stay healthy.
                    <br/><br/>
                    But it’s not just newborn puppies it can help…
                    <br/><br/>
                    It can help dogs of any age, size, or breed.

                        <br/><br/>
                        One of the ways colostrum can help relieve itching and scratching in dogs is by modulating their weak immune system, making it as strong as it once was, almost as if it ‘resets’ it.
                        <br/><br/>
                        It contains immunoglobulins (IgA, IgG, and IgM) that can bind to harmful substances like bacteria, viruses, and allergens, and neutralize them.
                        <br/><br/>
                        This can help reduce inflammation and other immune-related reactions that cause itching and scratching.

                        <br/><br/>
                        Colostrum also contains growth factors like insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) and transforming growth factor beta (TGF-β) that can promote tissue repair and regeneration.
                        <br/><br/>
                        This means that if the itching and scratching have caused skin damage, colostrum can help speed up the healing process and reduce the likelihood of infection.

                        Furthermore, colostrum contains bioactive peptides like lactoferrin and proline-rich polypeptides (PRPs) that have been shown to have anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory effects.
                        <br/><br/>
                        They can help regulate the immune system and reduce allergic reactions, which is the #1 cause of itching and scratching in dogs.

                    So I rang Richard to tell him the news.
                    <br/><br/>
                    At first, he wasn’t too excited.
                    <br/><br/>
                    After all, he’s tried countless times to relieve Marco’s terrible condition but never succeeded.
                    <br/><br/>
                    But he didn’t have a better option…
                    <br/><br/>
                    The kids were afraid to come too close to Marco…
                    <br/><br/>
                    Richard was hesitant to give him yet another oatmeal bath, as he could accidentally brush one of Marco’s red spots…
                    <br/><br/>
                    And the “anti-itch” sprays only made Marco’s fur seem more greasy & sticky than it already was.
                    <br/><br/>
                    So Richard took my advice.
                    <br/><br/>
                    The day I received the delivery of colostrum, I immediately went over to Richard’s place.
                    <br/><br/>
                    Since Marco often refused to eat due to the discomfort caused by his itching…
                    <br/><br/>
                    I also brought some chicken breasts to ensure he would consume the colostrum-laced meals.

                    But the answer I received wasn't what I had hoped for…

                    <br/><br/>
                    His shiny, gorgeous fur was almost restored…
                    <br/><br/>
                    And the burden of guilt and stress had finally lifted.

                    My wife and I realized that we had to share this solution with other dog owners, who experienced the same, devastating problem.
                    <br/><br/>
                    But before we share this with the world...
                    <br/><br/>
                    We had to make sure it works for other dogs, too.
                    <br/><br/>
                    So we went to my wife’s old friend, the veterinarian, to share this exciting discovery.
                    <br/><br/>
                    We encouraged her to give colostrum to some of her patients, who complained about their dog's excessive itching & scratching.

            <div>
                <p>The feedback was overwhelmingly positive.
                    <br/><br/>
                    We had managed to impress the vet clinic, so much that they connected us with a team of scientists who helped us perfect the formula.</p>
